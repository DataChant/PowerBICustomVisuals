# PowerBICustomVisuals
Alternative Exploration for Power BI Custom Visuals

This project can help you explore Power BI latest custom visuals in an alternative way which is offered by Microsoft through Office Store.

As a first step, you can use the Excel file "Custom Visuals.xlsm" to refresh and load all Custom Visuals into a table, and then download all sample PBIX files to a local folder.

With the sample PBIX file, which were created by Microsoft or by the 3rd party provider who developed these visuals, you can learn how to use the Custom Visuals.

Next, you can download the Power BI Report Custom Visuals.pbix to explore the latest visuals. Both Excel workbook and Power BI Report, apply Power Query (M) web scraping to download the list of Custom Visuals.

For more information on the queries, download the .xlsm or .pbix and review the queries.
